## BGx Graphics Framework

This is what happens when we love stuffs
1) libGDX (https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com)
2) C++

libGDX is a very flexible framework and I love it very much. 
I love c++ too. So I'm writing a cpp of libGDX. It is of own interest. No promises here. 

Though few good cpp ports are already available. These are the few reasons I'm doing it. 
1) Learn to write good cpp
2) Learn when where and how to abstract
3) Learn to use git effeciently
4) Document properly - may be use doxygen
5) Learn other related stuffs
